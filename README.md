# MFR2-Keyboard-Cases
This repository serves as a directory for those looking for a MFR2-style a case for a specific keyboard. The original design for MFR2 was done by rain and is linked below. All additional variants listed here have been designed and made available by myself.

## [Original MFR2](https://github.com/rainkeebs/mfr2)
This is the orignal MFR2 case designed by rain for tray mount minivan PCBs.
Additional versions of this (including one for 3D printing specifically) can be found in my fork of [the MFR2 repository](https://github.com/seirin-blu/mfr2)

## [QAZ MFR2](https://github.com/seirin-blu/QAZ-MFR)
This is a MFR2 variant meant to fit the QAZ PCB from Coffeebreak Keyboards. Utilizes a modified tray mount and brass heat set inserts.

## [BM16a MFR2](https://github.com/seirin-blu/BM16a-MFR2)
This is a MFR2 variant meant to fit the BM16a PCB from KPrepublic. Utilizes tray mount and brass heat set inserts.
This case will likely be updated in the future if a better PCB becomes available.

## [GH60 MFR2](https://github.com/seirin-blu/GH60-MFR2)
This is a MFR2 variant meant to fit USB C gh60 clones using the same mount pattern. Utilizes tray mount and brass heat set inserts.
Slight fitment issues at the moment and requires a small amount of sanding.

## [MFR2 V4N](https://github.com/seirin-blu/MFR2V4N)
This is a MFR2 variant meant to fit KiserDesign's Monorail and other V4N4G0N-like PCBs that share the mount pattern and rough edge cuts. Utilizes tray mount and brass heat set inserts.
Currently *only* 3D printable, but a modified variant that retains most of the design language while being able to be CNC'd is in the works.

## [Suffer MFR2](https://github.com/seirin-blu/Suffer-MFR2)
This is a MFR2 variant meant to fit KiserDesign/Zicodia's Suffer PCBs. Utilizes tray mount and brass heat set inserts.

## [Vault35 MFR2](https://github.com/seirin-blu/Vault35-MFR2)
These are MFR2 variants meant to fit both the WKL and HHKB variants of the Vault35 PCB by Mechvault. Utilizes bottom mount self tapping screws into the case if printed.

## [Cutiepie MFR2](https://github.com/seirin-blu/Cutiepie-MFR2) UNFINISHED
These are MFR2 variants meant to fit both the Ortho variant and Unistagger variant of the Cutiepie PCB by Flamwenco.
